## Brief Bio
I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Computer Science at the University of Oklahoma (OU). Before joining this amazing department I spent two years as an Assistant Scientist in the Computational Science Initiative at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Prior to that, I held a post-doctoral research position in the Computer Science Department of Rice University, where I was a member of Vivek Sarkar's Habanero Research group. I obtained my PhD at The Ohio State University, where I was advised by Prof. Louis-Noel Pouchet and Prof. (Saday) Sadayappan.

## Working with me

I am looking for smart, motivated, independent and hard-working students to join my research group. If you are interested in working on challenging problems in HPC / parallel programming / programming languages / compilers, send me an email with the following, or stop by my office at DEH 230. If sending me an email please include:

- Name
- Background: undergrad major, favorite courses, experience in HPC, programming languages, compilers, computer architecture
- Past experience: research, academic, industry
- Are you currently at OU or are you applying?

## Research Interests
My research leverages programming languages and compilers as vehicles to achieve high-performance on modern heterogeneous and complex architectures. To achieve this goal, I like to find synergies among these areas, the underlying architecture as well as domain and algorithmic knowledge.

- High-performance computing
- Domain-specific computing
- Polyhedral compilation
- Automatic parallelization for data-flow and task-parallel run-times
