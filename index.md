## Brief Bio

In June 2022 I joined the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at THE Ohio State University](https://cse.osu.edu/) as an Assistant Professor.
Prior to this I was an Assistant Professor in the [School of Computer Science at the University of Oklahoma (OU)](https://www.ou.edu/coe/cs).


## Research Interests

All of my research falls within the broad area of systems, and most of it within the sub-areas of Programming Languages and High Performance Computing (HPC). You can find OSU in [CSRankings](https://csrankings.org/#/index?hpc&plan&us). My research leverages programming languages and compilers as vehicles to achieve high-performance on modern heterogeneous and complex architectures. To achieve this goal, I like to find synergies among these areas, the underlying architecture as well as domain and algorithmic knowledge.

- Polyhedral compilation
- High-performance computing
- Domain-specific computing
- Quantum computing
- Automatic parallelization for data-flow and task-parallel run-times


## Funding

I'm currently externally funded by a PPoSS Large collaborative grant (Award Number 2234376) (Thank you NSF!), and I'm looking for students. If you are interested in my research, please see below.

[*Energy-Aware Tile Size Selection for Affine Programs on GPUs*](TBD) 
Malith Jayaweera, Martin Kong, Yanzhi Wang, David Kaeli.
In *International Code Generation and Optimization (CGO'24)*.
<details>
  Approach to selecting tile sizes for affine computations to be executed on GPUs. Tile sizes are selected to maximize inter-thread intra-SM data sharing instead of maximizing parallelism (i.e. number of threads) or maximizing intra-thread locality. Our approach restricts the liveness of data tiles in cache to achieve energy improvements of up to 6x. Our formulation, implemented and solved using the Z3 SMT solver, also takes into account the mapping of array references to different types of GPU memories (Shared-Memory, L1 and L2 cache) and several GPU hardware limits to maximmize resource usage while also aiming to minimize energy consumption and throughput.

<details>
<summary> Summary</summary>
  
The core contribution of this paper (one of my favorites!) is the design and implementation of a *performance lexicon* as an extensible set of Integer Linear
Program (ILP) cost functions, each of which attempts to maximize and extract a specific property on the optimized code. We define several cost functions, some 
heavily inspired in previous works, and others quite new. The motivation for having such lexicon is to be able to combine and reorder the ILP objectives based on the underlying computational and structural patterns found in the code.

<summary> Summary</summary>
  
Had a relatively minor role in this paper. I was at Rice at the time. It proposes techniques to simulate the cache behavior of affine programs. This work was later extended by Wenlei Bao in a [POPL'17 paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3158120) and then further extended by Gysi et al. in their [PLDI'19 paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3314221.3314606) for fully associative caches. The latter one produces approximated results, albeit much faster!

<details>
<summary> Summary</summary>
  
I started this work towards the end of my PhD, and finished it during my post-doc at Rice University. It proposes a polyhedral data-flow graph language and compiler that permits to define graph computations. The compiler applies loop transformations such as tiling and fusion to coarse and optimize the graph. In addition, it also extracts the necessary information from the input graph to automatically produce Intel CnC tuners, runtime calls that heavily influence the program's performance.

[*Compiler/runtime Framework for Dynamic Dataflow Parallelization of Tiled Programs.*](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2687652)

ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization (TACO),

<details>
<summary> Summary</summary>
  
This work started while in my internship at ENS Paris with Albert Cohen. The main contribution is the extraction of the necessary information to parallelize a tiled program and mapping it to a streaming task runtime with point-to-point communication capabilities, OpenStream. We use off-the-shelf polyhedral tools to compute the program synchronization points and instantiate the streams between producer and consumer tasks.

<summary> Summary</summary>
  
This paper had deep effects in the optimization of iterative stencil computations. I was not the first author, that was Kevin, but I did the implementation in PoCC/PolyOpt for the ROSE compiler framework. The main contribution was the observation that register pressure was a significant performance bottleneck in iterative stencil computations. The solution was pretty clever. We recasted the stencil by formulating it as a sum of products, leveraging associative reordering. Then, leveraging these properties allowed us to use fixed loop-shifting (a.k.a *retiming*) to aling the loads and stores. The value of this work resides in the trade-off between using high-dimensional stencils that will converge in fewer iterations than their lower-dimensional counterpart. This work was followed by a number of papers in Saday's and other research groups, including addressing the same issue in GPUs.

<details>
<summary> Summary</summary>
  
This is my very first paper, and probably my second favorite one, but a close call. The main contribution is a contract that establishes the roles and responsibilities between two powerful optimizing compilers, with the goal of synthesizing highly optimized SIMD-vectorized codelets. The first compiler finds and applies complex loop transformations to maximize and expose specific properties (e.g. permutability of loops). Later, the back-end compiler (Spiral), leverages the extracted and guaranteed properties to perform aggressive optimizations in straight-line code. The end result is a nice framework that achieves several commonly opposing goals: coarse-grained outer parallelism, locality and fine-grained (inner) vector-SIMD parallelism.
