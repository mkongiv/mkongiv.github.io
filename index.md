## Brief Bio

In June 2022 I joined the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at THE Ohio State University](https://cse.osu.edu/) as an Assistant Professor.



## Research Interests

My research falls within the broad area of systems intersected with the areas of Programming Languages, Compilers, and High Performance Computing (HPC). I leverage programming languages and compilers as vehicles to achieve high-performance on modern heterogeneous and complex architectures. To achieve this goal, I like to find synergies among these areas, the underlying architecture as well as domain and algorithmic knowledge.

- Communication minimization of distributed-memory computations
- Compiler energy-oriented transformations and optimizations for GPUs and hardware accelerators
- Polyhedral compilation
- High-performance computing
- Domain-specific computing
- Automatic parallelization for data-flow and task-parallel run-times
