## Brief Bio
I am an Assistant Professor in the [School of Computer Science at the University of Oklahoma (OU)](https://www.ou.edu/coe/cs). Before joining this amazing department I spent two years in the Computational Science Initiative at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Prior to that, I held a post-doctoral research position in the Computer Science Department of Rice University, where I was a member of Vivek Sarkar's Habanero Research group. I obtained my PhD at **THE Ohio State University**, where I was advised by Prof. Louis-Noel Pouchet and Prof. (Saday) Sadayappan.

## Research Interests
My research leverages programming languages and compilers as vehicles to achieve high-performance on modern heterogeneous and complex architectures. To achieve this goal, I like to find synergies among these areas, the underlying architecture as well as domain and algorithmic knowledge.

- High-performance computing
- Domain-specific computing
- Polyhedral compilation
- Automatic parallelization for data-flow and task-parallel run-times

<summary> Summary</summary>
  
The core contribution of this paper (one of my favorites!) is the design and implementation of a *performance lexicon* as an extensible set of Integer Linear
Program (ILP) cost functions, each of which attempts to maximize and extract a specific property on an optimized code. We define several cost functions, some 
heavily inspired in previous work, and others quite new. The motivation for having such lexicon is to be able to combine and reorder the ILP objectives based on the underlying computational and structured patterns found in the code.
