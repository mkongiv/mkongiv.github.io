## Brief Bio
I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Computer Science at the University of Oklahoma (OU). Before joining this amazing department I spent two years as an Assistant Scientist in the Computational Science Initiative at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Prior to that, I held a post-doctoral research position in the Computer Science Department of Rice University, where I was a member of Vivek Sarkar's Habanero Research group. I obtained my PhD at The Ohio State University, where I was advised by Prof. Louis-Noel Pouchet and Prof. (Saday) Sadayappan.
